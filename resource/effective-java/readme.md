# Item - 1: CONSIDER STATIC FACTORY METHODS INSTEAD OF CONSTRUCTORS
#### static factory method instead of constructors
- they have names
- unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked
- they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
- returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters. (see EnumSet `noneOf` method)
- the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written (see `JDBC`)
#### Code Convention
- `from`, a type conversion method `Date d =Date.from(instant);`
- `of`, an aggregation method `Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);`
- `valueOf`, more verbose `BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE);`
- `getInstance`, `create`, `newInstance`, 
- `getType`, `newType` when factory method is in different class like `BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);`

# Item - 2: CONSIDER A BUILDER WHEN FACED WITH MANY CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS
- The Builder pattern simulates named optional parameters
- easy to write/read client code
- parameterized varargs
- ensure immutability 

# Item - 3: ENFORCE THE SINGLETON PROPERTY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR OR AN ENUM TYPE
- A singleton is simply a class that is instantiated exactly once
- We can enforce a Singleton property using private constructor with static factory method like below:
```java
public class DataSource {
    
    private static final DataSource ds = new DataSource();
    
    private DataSource() {
        
    }
    
    public static DataSource getDataSource() {
        return ds;
    }
}
```
- A one can access private Constructor by using Reflective API, we need to throw exception in constructor for this case
- Add `transient` for all fields and `readResolve` method for Serialization/Deserialization to make sure it remains singleton 
- Single Element Enum is the best way to implement a Singleton

ITEM 4: ENFORCE NON-INSTANTIABILITY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR
- Should add a private constructor to make a class non instantiable (mostly with Utility class, see `java.lang.Math` )

ITEM 5: PREFER DEPENDENCY INJECTION TO HARDWIRING RESOURCES
- Do not use a singleton or static utility class to implement a class that depends on one or more underlying resources
- Passing the resource into the constructor is called dependency Injection
- Dependency Injection (DI) enhance the Flexibility, re-usability and testability of a Class








## Extra notes
### Java Bean Pattern
- no arg constructor with setters
- disadvantages like multiple calls for this construction, cannot achieve immutability
### Constructor telescoping
- We can have multiple constructors which are delegating to other one (like 1-arg constructor to 2-arg constructor with second parameter is null)
- hard to write client code when there are many parameters, and harder still to read it.
