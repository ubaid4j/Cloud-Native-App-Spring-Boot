## Creating and Destroying Objects
#### Item - 1: CONSIDER STATIC FACTORY METHODS INSTEAD OF CONSTRUCTORS
###### static factory method instead of constructors
- they have names
- unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked
- they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
- returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters. (see EnumSet `noneOf` method)
- the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written (see `JDBC`)
###### Code Convention
- `from`, a type conversion method `Date d =Date.from(instant);`
- `of`, an aggregation method `Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);`
- `valueOf`, more verbose `BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE);`
- `getInstance`, `create`, `newInstance`, 
- `getType`, `newType` when factory method is in different class like `BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);`

#### Item - 2: CONSIDER A BUILDER WHEN FACED WITH MANY CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS
- The Builder pattern simulates named optional parameters
- easy to write/read client code
- parameterized varargs
- ensure immutability 

#### Item - 3: ENFORCE THE SINGLETON PROPERTY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR OR AN ENUM TYPE
- A singleton is simply a class that is instantiated exactly once
- We can enforce a Singleton property using private constructor with static factory method like below:
```java
public class DataSource {
    
    private static final DataSource ds = new DataSource();
    
    private DataSource() {
        
    }
    
    public static DataSource getDataSource() {
        return ds;
    }
}
```
- A one can access private Constructor by using Reflective API, we need to throw exception in constructor for this case
- Add `transient` for all fields and `readResolve` method for Serialization/Deserialization to make sure it remains singleton 
- Single Element Enum is the best way to implement a Singleton

#### ITEM 4: ENFORCE NON-INSTANTIABILITY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR
- Should add a private constructor to make a class non instantiable (mostly with Utility class, see `java.lang.Math` )

#### ITEM 5: PREFER DEPENDENCY INJECTION TO HARDWIRING RESOURCES
- Do not use a singleton or static utility class to implement a class that depends on one or more underlying resources
- Passing the resource into the constructor is called dependency Injection
- Dependency Injection (DI) enhance the Flexibility, re-usability and testability of a Class

#### ITEM 6: AVOID CREATING UNNECESSARY OBJECTS
- Do not create object when you can reuse existing one like 
`String str = new String("Java");` is bad practice to create new String as it is creating one extra object as argument `Java` to constructor `new String("Java")` is itself an instance.
- Immutable Objects can be reused and there is no need to create a new Immutable Object
- Equal Functionality Objects can be reused (see Pattern Compile vs String matches) (see autoboxing)

#### ITEM 7: ELIMINATE OBSOLETE OBJECT REFERENCES
- An obsolete reference is simply a reference that will never be de-referenced again.
- If an object reference is unintentionally retained, this Objects and other all objects referenced by this object will be excluded from GC and thus will cause memory leaks.
  - nulling the obsolete element by ourselves 
- Another common source of memory leaks is caches.
  - Use other processes (WeakHashMap or ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor) to clean out the unused keys
- Listener and other callbacks can cause memory leaks as well.
- If you register callbacks but do not de-register then they will accumulate and thus causing memory leaks

#### ITEM 8: AVOID FINALIZERS AND CLEANERS
- Don't use Finalizer
- Don't use Cleaners


#### ITEM 9: Prefer `try-with-resources` to `try-finallay`
- code with `try-finally`
  ```
    static void copy(String src, String dst) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new FileInputStream(src);
        try {
            OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(dst);
            try {
                byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
                int n;
                while ((n = in.read(buf)) >= 0) {
                    out.write(buf, 0, n);
                }
            } finally {
                out.close();
            }
        } finally {
            in.close();
        }

    }
  ```
- same above code with `try-with-resource`
  ```
    static void copy(String src, String dst) throws IOException {
        try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(src);
             OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(dst)) {
            byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
            int n;
            while ((n = in.read(buf)) >= 0) {
                out.write(buf, 0, n);
            }
        }
    }
  ```
- more readable, shorter
- we get very first exceptions with later one suppressed automatically
  - first exception mean the actual exception generated during opening a file in above `copy` method
  - later exceptions might be exceptions in close method of `AutoCloseable` resource 

## Methods Common to All Objects
#### ITEM 10: OBEY THE GENERAL CONTRACT WHEN OVERRIDING EQUALS
- When overriding `equals()` method, then make sure following contract if fulfill
  - Reflexive:   x.equals(x) => true
  - Symmetric:  x.equals(y) && y.equals(x) => true
  - Transitive:  x.equals(y) && y.equals(z) && x.equals(z) => true
  - Consistent: multiple invocations produce same results 
  - x.equals(null) => false 
- To avoid symmetric violation, our equals method should compare same instances
- To avoid transitivity, we should prefer composition to inheritance
- How to override `equals` method
  - use `==` to check argument is a reference to this object
  - use `instanceof` operator to check argument has the correct type
  - cast the argument to correct type
  - check each `significant` field of class with the corresponding fields of argument
  - Example
   ```
    class Point {
        private final int x;
        private final int y;

        public Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            if (o == this) return true;
            if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false;
            Point p = (Point) o;
            return p.x == x && p.y == y;
       }
    }
   ``` 
  - Instead of overriding equals method by ourselves, use auto generated equals by IDEs or Annotations (which override `equals` in compiled code instead of codebase)

#### ITEM 11: ALWAYS OVERRIDE HASHCODE WHEN YOU OVERRIDE EQUALS
- Contract for hashCode()
  - return consistent same value on each invocation
  - if o1.equals(o2) then o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()
  - if o1 is not equals to o2 then it preferable to have distinct hash codes
- How to write `hashCode()` method
  - Initialize int result = 1;
  - And for each significant fields:
    - result = 31 * result + Type.hashCode(field)
  - return result
- There is method `Objects.hash(Object ...)` which calculate the hash using the same above algorithm, but it is not good for performance as it create Array of Object and boxing/unboxing of primitive types
- Example
  ```
  class Coordinate {
    final int x;
    final int y;

    public Coordinate(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == this) return true;
        if (!(obj instanceof Coordinate)) return false;
        Coordinate c1 = (Coordinate) obj;
        return c1.x == x && c1.y == y;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = 1;
        result = 31 * result + Integer.hashCode(x);
        result = 31 * result + Integer.hashCode(y);
        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Coordinate{" +
            "x=" + x +
            ", y=" + y +
            '}';
    }
  }
  ``` 
  - We used 31 as it is prime odd and the VM can convert the multiplication to shift.
    - 31 * result ===  (result << 5) - result

#### ITEM 12: ALWAYS OVERRIDE toString
#### ITEM 13: OVERRIDE CLONE JUDICIOUSLY
- Object's clone method returns a field by field copy of the object
- contract: 
  ```
    x.clone() != x
    x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
    x.clone().equals(x)
  ``` 
- Copying arrays is the sole compelling use of `clone` facility
- `clone` is doing shallow copy (we need to add extra functionality to make it deep copy)
- How to Clone
  - Override clone with public method which return the same type (containing clas)
  - class `super.clone()` first
  - fix any fields that need fixing (like fields that contain deep structure)
- Better approach is `copy constructor` or `copy factory`

#### ITEM-14: CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING COMPARABLE
- Contract
  - returns  0  if this object is equals to other one
  - returns -1  if this object is less than to other one
  - returns  1  if this object is greater than to other one
  - sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))
    - sgn is a function which returns -1 for any negative value, +1 for any positive value and 0 for 0
  - Must follow transitivity
  - If x.compareTo(y) == 0 then sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sng(y.compareTo(z))
  - If x.compareTo(y) == 0 then x.equals(y)
#### ITEM-14: MINIMIZE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF CLASSES AND MEMBERS
- Reduce accessibility of program elements as much as possible
  - Top level (not nested) classes has only two possible access levels
     - package-private (no requirement to have same name as file name, and there can be multiple classes in a file)
     - public (class name should be same file name, and there can be only one public class)
  - Prefer package-private class
  - For members (fields, methods, nested classes and nested interfaces), following are access level
    - private (only accessible from the top level class where it is declared)
    - package-private (accessible from any class in the package where it is declared)
    - protected (accessible from subclasses)
    - public (accessible from anywhere) 
  - An overridden method in subclass cannot have a more restrictive access level 

## Extra notes
### Java Bean Pattern
- no arg constructor with setters
- disadvantages like multiple calls for this construction, cannot achieve immutability
### Constructor telescoping
- We can have multiple constructors which are delegating to other one (like 1-arg constructor to 2-arg constructor with second parameter is null)
- hard to write client code when there are many parameters, and harder still to read it.
